            <h1>Who Am I?</h1>
           <p>I believe it’s all about being happy. To me, happiness is the root of everything
           good in our lives. I want my life to be filled opportunities of happiness, so therefore
           I want a job suited my skills. Some of my skills include being, very driven, very well
           equipped to handle people, and good in participating in a team. So far no careers that
           have been presented before me have been completely floored men, so using the skills that
           I have at hand, I would like to broaden my knowledge of careers possible. 
           </p>

           <h2>"One To Strive To Excellence Through Efforts" 
           </h2>
           </div>
           <br>
           <p>I have always been very driven, as it ties in very well with my competitive nature.
           To me I always tell myself, that I have enough skill and patience to be the best, and 
           to keep up with that I always try my best. This concept was drilled even harder into my 
           head, through the numerous years of martial arts. “One to strive for excellence through 
           efforts”. This quote plays a big part in the reason that I am driven, as I always want 
           to demonstrate to people that I am dedicated to a cause. To me, there is no better way
           to being dedicated to a cause than to be driven. Though I am very driven, I will never 
           put forth the idea of cheating or finding shortcuts to produce, as it goes against some 
           of my most basic morals.</p>
           <br>
           <p>As mentioned above I also work extremely well with people in a team. This is solely
           because of my multiple years of being in various sports. I have participated in various
           team sports such as, soccer, basketball, tennis, and cricket. Participating in team
           sports has led me to be work well with others and to lead properly. I have used these
           skills in various group projects, where I have led others by example, such as the CAP 
           project. This CAP project was a project to bring social awareness about the litter found 
           across our town. My group and I worked together for over one month, giving me plenty of 
           opportunity to showcase my teamwork and leadership skills. </p>
           <br>
           <p>Overall, using my skills that I have gained over the years I would like to find a
           applicable job that will keep me happy. I am nowhere near to mastering anything, but 
           there is a road ahead. Thank you. I would like to thank you for taking the time to read 
           through my website. Feel free to look through the rest of the website for more 
           information about me, and if you have any questions, send me an email, found in the 
           contacts page.
