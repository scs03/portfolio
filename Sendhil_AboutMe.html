              <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
             <p>Hi my name is Sriram Sendhil, and I am currently a sophmore are Dublin High School, and will be graduating in the year 2021.
                  I am an extremely active person that enjoys anything in the outdoors. Activities that I participated in he outdoors is the 
                  reason as to why I am where I am. Activities such as soccer, karate, cricket, swimming, tennis, track, and basketball all have 
                  influenced for the better. All these various sports have thaught me how to handle working in a team, and how to lead a 
                  group confidentely. Many of my leadrship skills have come from understanding how to make people feel like part of a team, 
                  which is something I heavily focus on. I have always lived by the quote that, 
             </p>
             <h4>"We must remeber that one determined person can
                  make a significant difference, and that a small group of determined people can change the course of history" - Sonia Johnson
             </h4>
             <br>
             <p>Quotes such as this are the reason that I live the way I do. Morals have always influenced the desicions that I've made, and have 
             steered me away from desicions that I would have repented. Though I may be energetic and fun to interact with, I get very driven to 
             work my hardest, as it rewards me with the most pride and joy. </p>
